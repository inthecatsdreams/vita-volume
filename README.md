# Vita Volume

An application to set your vita volume level without using the volume buttons (useful if they are broken)
@theheroGAC completely rewrote the application to make it more modern and easy to use, all credits go to him!


# How to use

Set the value you want, 0 being the lowest and 30 the maximum (25 for AVLS forced vitas)
and then press square to reboot.
You can also disable AVLS for a short while, it's basically a shortcut to the option you have in the settings app.
# How to build

First you need the vitasdk installed on your computer.
Then go in the directory and type
```cmake .```
then
```make```
And if everything is setup properly you should get the vpk.
